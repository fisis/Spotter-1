abstract = {Many neurological and psychiatric diseases are associated with clinically detectable, altered brain dynamics. The aberrant brain activity, in principle, can be restored through electrical stimulation. In epilepsies, abnormal patterns emerge intermittently, and therefore, a closed-loop feedback brain control that leaves other aspects of brain functions unaffected is desirable. Here, we demonstrate that seizure-triggered, feedback transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can dramatically reduce spike-and-wave episodes in a rodent model of generalized epilepsy. Closed-loop TES can be an effective clinical tool to reduce pathological brain patterns in drug-resistant patients.},

@article{Girardeau2009,
abstract = {Sharp wave-ripple (SPW-R) complexes in the hippocampus-entorhinal cortex are believed to be important for transferring labile memories from the hippocampus to the neocortex for long-term storage. We found that selective elimination of SPW-Rs during post-training consolidation periods resulted in performance impairment in rats trained on a hippocampus-dependent spatial memory task. Our results provide evidence for a prominent role of hippocampal SPW-Rs in memory consolidation.},
